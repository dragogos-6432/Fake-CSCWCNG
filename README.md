# Fake-CSCWCNG
This is a fake CSCWCNG DLL which emulates a Wincor Nixdorf/Diebold Nixdorf cash dispenser for use for ATM malware analysis without needing to have a whole ATM or the hard to get ProBase NDC.
The DLL works with most ATM malware samples that attack this type of ATM. Some exports are missing or don't do the intended thing they need to yet. Hopefully in newer versions it will be better.

Here is the DLL in action:
